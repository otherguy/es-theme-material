# EmulationStation Material Theme

This is based on the [**Material** v2 theme](https://github.com/lilbud/es-theme-material) by [Lilbud](https://github.com/lilbud). He did all the heavy lifting and all credit goes to the original author!

I added the game details, a few systems and made the font more readable on tiny screens.

## Changelog

- `v0.1` Inital release

## Missing Systems

- Multiple Emulator Super System
- Famicom
- Super Famicom
